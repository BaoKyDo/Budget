# Budget

This application will have two screens. The overflow menu in the action bar will change to
reflect the action needed to return to the previous screen (see sample on next page):

1. on the first, Budget Summary screen, the user will see input boxes to enter the monthly
income from employment Earnings and Loans. The lower part of the screen will later show
the calculated Total Expenses after returning from the second screen.
2. Immediately after the user enters any income value, the Total Income should be calculated
and displayed. If there is a Total Income value, the Surplus / Shortfall value should be
updated (see A 5 below).
3. When the user taps the Calculate Expenses button on the first screen or selects the
Expenses menu option from the overflow menu then the app should display the second
Enter Expense Amounts screen.
4. On the second Enter Expense Amounts screen, the user will select whether the amounts
are monthly or annual values and enter amounts for the listed expense categories.
Immediately after the user enters any values in this screen, the appropriate totals should
be calculated and displayed: ( Total Housing Costs, Total Education Costs and Total
Expenses). The calculations are shown in Part B 2 below.
5. After the user taps the ACCEPT button or selects the Accept menu option from the
overflow menu, the app should return to the first screen to display the Total Expenses and
calculate and display the Surplus / Shortfall (Shortfalls should appear as negative). See Part
B 2 below.
6. the action bar on the first screen will have an overflow menu with options for Expenses and
Quit. When the second screen is displayed, the menu should change to Show options for

Accept and Quit. The Expenses and Accept menus should perform the same action as the
corresponding Calculate Expenses and Accept Buttons.
7. (Optional) You may make your layouts responsive to portrait and landscape device
orientation, but it is not required for this project.
